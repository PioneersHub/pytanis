Find External Reviewers and Learn about their Preferences","text":"<p>For the PyConDE / PyData Berlin 2023, we were looking for about 50 external reviewers since we expected about 400 proposals, and we wanted to have 3 reviews per proposal. This would amount to about 25 proposals to review per person, which is manageable within a few weeks if you schedule 5-15 minutes per proposal.</p> <p>To get external reviewers, we decided that would only ask within our (Program Committee members') circle of trust and refer them to Google Forms. The form basically consisted of following questions with descriptions:</p> <ul> <li>Name [short answer]: Please write your name starting with your first name, e.g. Albert Einstein.</li> <li>Affiliation [short answer]: Please state the name or organisation you are affiliated with.</li> <li>Who do you know from the Committee? [short answer]: We believe in the ring of trust model. With this question, we really only   want to make sure that random people are not signing up with no connection to any member of the Program Committee.</li> <li>Availability during the Review Period [checkboxes]: The bulk of the review work will take place from January 5<sup>th</sup> to February   13<sup>th</sup>, 2023, so it is important that you are broadly available during this period. That being said, you will be quite   flexible in managing your time but being on vacation with no internet for 3 weeks might be suboptimal here ;-)   There was only one mandatory checkbox: Yes, I am broadly available during this period.</li> <li>Additional comments regarding your availability during the review period. [long answer]</li> <li>Topics you want to review: These are the topics you are interested in reviewing. The more you select the better.   Don't be shy, you don't have to be an expert in a topic to review a proposal. If you are interested in a topic and   have some knowledge about it, you are totally up for the job :-)   Each track in Pretalx corresponded to one checkbox in this form. At least 5 preferences needed to be chosen.</li> <li>Do you want your name to be listed as a reviewer on the conference website? [checkbox] Mandatory yes/no checkboxes</li> <li>Any additional comments for the Program Committee [long answer]</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <ul> <li>Google Form will use the separator <code>,</code> (comma, whitespace) for the selected checkboxes. Having the same separator   in your track name, e.g. \"General: Community, Diversity, Career, Life and everything else\", will make it a bit harder   to parse the resulting Google Sheet. So it's better to avoid them in track names.</li> <li>Depending on how you want to assign proposals to reviewers later, it might also make sense to ask the reviewers if   they only want to be assigned a single batch, or if they are also interested in getting more proposals to review after   their batch is done.</li> </ul> <p>Every submission of the Google Form is then automatically added to a Google Sheet, let's call it the volunteer sheet, which can be easily read with the help of Pytanis. Check out our Google Sheet docs and Pytanis' google module to learn about more functionality.</p>"},{"location":"tasks/review/#2-onboard-reviewers-in-pretalx","title":"2. Onboard Reviewers in Pretalx","text":"<p>In Pretalx select Organisers in the left menu bar (you need Admin-rights for that) and click the teams under your event name. You should see a list of all teams and it's a good idea to have one for all reviewers, e.g. <code>2023-Reviewers-ALL</code>. By clicking on the team name you get to a page that lists the names and corresponding e-mails of team members as well as an option to add new members at the bottom.</p> <p>You can now start typing in the e-mail addresses from the volunteer sheet to send out invitations to them. After volunteers accept the invitation they will show up with a user-name and e-mail in the team table. Now, here comes the tricky part that can cause a lot of confusion. If person A entered in the Google Form the e-mail address <code>work@mail.com</code>, and you added this in Pretalx, it might happen that person A accepts the team invitation with a different Pretalx account that is linked to the e-mail address <code>private@mail.com</code>. In this case, Pretalx will automatically replace <code>work@mail.com</code>, which was used for the invitation, with <code>private@mail.com</code> in the Pretalx table of team members. Unfortunately, Pretalx has no way of automatically tracking this change of mail addresses and this issue, as filed in #1417, is still unresolved.</p> <p>To work around this email issue and to be able to later join your volunteer sheet for instance with reviews, it makes sense to introduce a new column, e.g. \"Pretalx mail\", where you add the actual Pretalx account e-mail that was used by the invited user. Additionally, you should have a column for the Pretalx user-name, e.g. \"Pretalx user\", where you state the user-name by copying it over from the Pretalx team member table. This user-name column will be useful later to join our volunteer reviewers with the reviews they did, because the review-endpoint of Pretalx only returns the user-name, not the e-mail of a reviewer. This problem was also discussed in #1416 and is an intended behaviour.</p>"},{"location":"tasks/review/#3-assign-proposals-to-reviewers-according-to-their-preferences","title":"3. Assign Proposals to Reviewers according to their Preferences","text":"<p>Pretalx already provides a basic assignment feature so that proposals with the least number of reviews will show up earlier in the review queue so that they get more reviews. Additionally, Pretalx allows uploading a mapping JSON file so that you can assign certain proposals to a reviewer matching their preferences with the tracks of the proposals. Also, Pretalx is working on more elaborate automatic assignment features and some discussion about it can be found in issue #1331.</p> <p>Pytanis allows you to create JSON mapping files that can be uploaded in Pretalx under Review \u00bb Assign reviews. Then click Actions (upper right) \u00bb Import assignments and select the option <code>Assign proposals to reviewers</code>, choose the JSON file and make sure to always set <code>Replace current assignments</code> to <code>Yes</code>. Overwriting the current assignments makes sure that the assignment state in Pretalx is always consistent with what you expect. Also, be sure to always back up your assignment files somewhere in case you need to roll back later on. To make this easy, just name your files <code>assignments-YYYYMMDD_I.json</code>, where <code>YYYY</code> is the current year, <code>MM</code> the month, <code>DD</code> the day in the month and <code>I</code> the version increment, e.g. <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, in case you need several assignments throughout the same day.</p> <p>So how do you create an assignment file using Pytanis? Currently, we have implemented in a notebook an initial simple algorithm that can be easily run. Fancier algorithms will come in the future and don't hesitate to contribute. The main idea of the algorithm is to set a goal of number of reviews for each proposal, e.g. 3 reviews, and a certain buffer, e.g. 1. This means every proposal is assigned to goal number of reviews + buffer - current review number in case the current review number is not already equal or greater than the goal number of reviews. Rerunning this assignment frequently helps to avoid overshooting as the buffer mainly addresses the fact that you will also have inactive reviewers or some that start on the last day before your review deadline. For each proposal and remaining review, the algorithm assigns the proposals to:</p> <ul> <li>not a person having already assigned the review for a proposal (no duplicates),</li> <li>to a person having a preference for the track with the least amount of current work,</li> <li>if no person has a preference for the track of the proposal, assign to someone with not much work.</li> </ul> <p>Be aware that some of your reviewers might have also make proposal submissions. Thus, it might happen by chance that someone gets assigned his/her own proposal using this approach but luckily Pretalx takes care of that--if the same Pretalx account was used.</p> <p>This quite simple algorithm can be found in the notebook 10_reviewer-assignment_v1. It uses Pytanis to pull the submission/proposals as well as the current reviews from Pretalx and joins them to get an overview of the current state of reviews. Then Pytanis is used to get the Google sheet of reviewers and their preferences, which is also joined with the data from Pretalx. Then the aforementioned algorithm is run and the assignment JSON file written.</p>"},{"location":"tasks/review/#4-communicate-with-the-reviewers-occasionally-for-updates","title":"4.

So this feature is pretty need but for larger conferences with a lot of parallel sessions, i.e. many rooms, some help might be needed.</p> <p>Assuming that you had some blank schedule before that already defines the time slots with their lengths and when the breaks are, then surely following constraints must be satisfied:</p> <ul> <li>each talk must be assigned to a time slot,</li> <li>each room/time slot combination can only be occupied by one talk at most,</li> <li>the length of the time slot must match the length of the talk,</li> <li>if some talks/tutorials have several parts, e.g. part 1 &amp; 2, they must be consecutive.</li> </ul> <p>Besides those constraints you might want to optimize for several objectives:</p> <ol> <li>the preferences for day and time of the speakers are considered (if they provided some),</li> <li>the more popular a talk is (from the public voting data), the more capacity the assigned room should have,</li> <li>if many people are highly interested in seeing two talks (voting data), these talks should rather not be scheduled in parallel.    Also, sponsored talks should never be in parallel to avoid cannibalization,</li> <li>talks should have same main track, e.g. PyData, if they are in the same session (block of talks in one room),</li> <li>talks should have same sub track, e.g. PyData: Data Handling, if they are in the same session.</li> </ol> <p>The easiest way of dealing with multi-objective optimization is to create one new main objective by weighting and summing all objectives. For the objectives outlined above, it surely makes sense to choose the weights so that the importance is 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 5.</p> <p>In the notebook 50_scheduling_v1, you can find an example that uses Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) to generate a preliminary schedule that can be used as a starting point before creating the schedule in Pretalx. Although the constraints and objective from above may look quite simple, MIPs are not only hard, they are even NP-hard ;-) The example in the notebook uses Pyomo to formulate the problem and transform it into a standardized form, so that the solver HiGHS can do its job. In the concrete example, even after 24h no perfect solution was found, but the good thing is that the gap between best found feasible solution and the maximum possible objective value, i.e. the gap, was relatively small.</p> <p>Again, to visualize a solution like this, you can push it easily with the help of Pytanis to Google Sheets,  which is illustrated in the figure below.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you want to also specify link previews, sometimes also called a social banners, then check out the notebook 40_talk_image_v1 on how Pytanis can help you to create them.</p>"},{"location":"tasks/selection/","title":"The Selection Process","text":""},{"location":"tasks/selection/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>On a high-level, the selection process involves the following</p> <ol> <li>have an optional public voting for the proposals,</li> <li>decide on how many talks, tutorials in which length, track or skill level you want to have,</li> <li>get an overview of the proposals, the speakers, the reviewer scores, and optionally the vote scores,</li> <li>select in Pretalx which talks are accepted and which ones are not.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"tasks/selection/#1-optional-public-voting","title":"1.

Diversity is also an important topic, so one rule might be to over-represent the under-represented but by how much? And do you expect your audience to be rather advanced, even senior, and what does that mean for ratio of the various required skill levels of the talks? How about the tracks you defined?

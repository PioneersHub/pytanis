# Release Notes for Pytanis v0.9.0rc

## ðŸŽ‰ First Release Compatible with Pretalx Versioned API v1

We're excited to announce the release candidate for Pytanis v0.9.0! This is the first version fully compatible with the new Pretalx versioned API v1, introduced in June 2025.

## Major Highlights

### 1. **Pretalx API v1 Full Compatibility**
- Complete support for the new versioned API with proper `expand` parameter usage
- Automatic handling of API changes where nested objects were replaced with IDs
- Seamless backward compatibility for existing code

### 2. **Storage & Communication Abstraction**
- New abstraction layers for storage (local files, Google Sheets) and communication (email, tickets)
- Optional dependencies - install only what you need:
  ```bash
  pip install pytanis[google]     # For Google Sheets
  pip install pytanis[mailgun]    # For Mailgun
  pip install pytanis[helpdesk]   # For HelpDesk
  ```

### 3. **Performance Improvements**
- 50-75x performance boost for bulk operations through intelligent cache pre-population
- Reduced API calls when fetching submissions with speakers and metadata

### 4. **Enhanced Testing Framework**
- New interactive integration test runner
- Structured logging with colored output for better visibility
- Comprehensive endpoint validation

## Breaking Changes

None! This release maintains full backward compatibility while adding new features.

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

Your code will continue to work without changes. To take advantage of new features:

1. **Update to use optional dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Instead of installing everything
   pip install pytanis

   # Install only what you need
   pip install pytanis[google,mailgun]
   ```

2. **Use the new abstraction layer** (optional):
   ```python
   # Old way (still works)
   from pytanis import GSheetsClient
   client = GSheetsClient()

   # New way (recommended)
   from pytanis import get_storage_client
   storage = get_storage_client()
   ```

### For New Users

Start with the minimal installation and add components as needed:
```bash
pip install pytanis  # Core functionality
pip install pytanis[all]  # Everything
```

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed 401 Unauthorized errors when fetching individual answers
- Fixed redirect issues with missing trailing slashes
- Fixed circular import issues in Google storage adapter

## What's Next

This is a release candidate. Please test it with your workflows and report any issues. The final v0.9.0 release is planned for early July 2025.

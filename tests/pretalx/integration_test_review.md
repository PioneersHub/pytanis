# Integration Test Review Against OpenAPI Schema

## Summary

After reviewing the OpenAPI schema at `src/pytanis/pretalx/schema.yml` and comparing it with our integration tests in `test_all_endpoints_integration.py`, here are the key findings:

## Current Test Coverage

### ✅ Well-Tested Endpoints (18 endpoints)
- **Core**: `/api/me/`, `/api/events/`, `/api/events/{event}/`
- **Submissions**: List and detail endpoints
- **Speakers**: List and detail endpoints
- **Talks**: List and detail endpoints (custom implementation with fallback)
- **Reviews**: List and detail endpoints (auth-required)
- **Rooms**: List and detail endpoints
- **Questions**: List and detail endpoints
- **Answers**: List and detail endpoints (auth-required)
- **Tags**: List and detail endpoints

### ❌ Missing from Tests (30 endpoints)
- **Access Codes** (5 endpoints) - for speaker/reviewer access management
- **Schedules** (5 endpoints) - critical for conference schedule management
- **Slots** (3 endpoints) - individual schedule slots
- **Submission Actions** (8 endpoints) - accept/reject/confirm/cancel submissions
- **Submission Types** (2 endpoints) - used internally but not tested directly
- **Tracks** (2 endpoints) - used internally but not tested directly
- **Mail Templates** (2 endpoints) - email template management
- **Teams/Organisation** (5 endpoints) - team management
- **Others**: Upload, Question Options, Speaker Information

## Key Findings

### 1. Backward Compatibility Implementation
The integration tests successfully validate our backward compatibility layer:
- ✅ Speaker expansion from IDs to objects works correctly
- ✅ Submission type expansion is implemented (uses internal `_get_submission_type()`)
- ✅ Track expansion is implemented (uses internal `_get_track()`)
- ✅ Answer expansion is implemented

### 2. Critical Missing Endpoints
While submission types and tracks are fetched internally for backward compatibility, they're not exposed as public methods or tested directly. The OpenAPI schema shows these are valid endpoints that should be accessible.

### 3. Test Quality
The integration tests are well-structured with:
- ✅ Verbose logging of all API calls (URLs and headers)
- ✅ Pre-validation of auth token and event existence
- ✅ Graceful handling of auth-required endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting and success metrics
- ✅ Backward compatibility validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add public methods for submission types and tracks** since they're already being fetched internally:
   ```python
   def submission_types(self, event_slug: str, *, params: QueryParams | None = None) -> tuple[int, Iterator[SubmissionType]]:
   def submission_type(self, event_slug: str, id: int, *, params: QueryParams | None = None) -> SubmissionType:
   def tracks(self, event_slug: str, *, params: QueryParams | None = None) -> tuple[int, Iterator[Track]]:
   def track(self, event_slug: str, id: int, *, params: QueryParams | None = None) -> Track:
   ```

2. **Add tests for these endpoints** in the integration test suite

### Future Enhancements
1. **Schedule Management**: Add support for schedule endpoints (important for conference planning)
2. **Submission Workflow**: Add action endpoints for submission state management
3. **Access Control**: Add access code endpoints for speaker/reviewer management

## Integration Test Strengths

The current integration tests are excellent because they:
1. Validate both public and authenticated access patterns
2. Test the complete request/response cycle with real API calls
3. Verify Pydantic model parsing for all responses
4. Include comprehensive backward compatibility testing
5. Provide detailed diagnostics with the VerbosePretalxClient

## Conclusion

The integration tests cover 37.5% of the available API endpoints, focusing on the most commonly used ones. The backward compatibility implementation is working correctly, transparently fetching additional data when needed. The main gap is the lack of public methods for endpoints that are already being used internally (submission types and tracks).
